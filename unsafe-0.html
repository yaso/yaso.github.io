					<h3>Unsafe, but sane</h3>
					<p>This work is an attempt to investigate the structured future that awaits us, and how can humanity use the Internet and not lose the fundamental human rights due to control and surveillance. </p>

				<li>
					<p>Here lies the presentation made at one of the Fellows Hour, at the Berkman Klein Center - along with my verbal explanation. The links aside contain some sources and references. </p>

					<p>To investigate the problem, I'll make use of Design Fiction. A variation of critical design, but used to deal with stories from cyberspace. Bruce Sterling used this term in 2005 in his book called Shaping things. There is an unmissable article written by him in <a href="http://www.wired.co.uk/article/patently-untrue">the Wired UK</a> about Design Fiction. As I wish to solve a problem that is not real but is a possible future, Design Fiction will help me to tell this story.

					<p>The story that I want to tell presents some troubled unintentional uses of data technologies. As we go digital, we go more structured than ever. In this world, people do everything they can to fit in data models so that they can track everything as a resource and get efficiency. The body is an extension of the digital world and can't function separated from it. </p>
						<a data-flickr-embed="true" data-context="true"  href="https://slides.com/yasodara/deck-1/live#/2" title="slide3"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/3/2925/33442932330_d37835b700_c.jpg" width="800" height="563" alt="slide3"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
					<hr class="fancy-line"></hr>
				</li>
<!--slide 4-->
				<li>
					<p>Our actions are redesigned so they can be translated for machines correctly. As a consequence of the need of controlling everything to obtain efficiency, we let ourselves convert into tables and columns, or other structures that have their roots in mathematical equations.
					So, to tell everyone what we are doing, we trade off complexity for structured exchanges about what we are doing. This register also base our next steps. Everything is a consequence of real parameters founded in science: the amount a person walks, eats, socialize, works, run, commute, watch movies. In a way that we are finally safe from errors.  </p>

				<hr class="fancy-line"></hr>
				</li>
<!--slide 4-->
				<li>
					<p>In this world, there will be new grids for distribution of everything. New networks for organizing in the best way we can afford - new paths that indicated by the protocols.  </p>
						<a data-flickr-embed="true" data-context="true"  href="https://slides.com/yasodara/deck-1/live#/5" title="slideResources"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/3/2912/33835649685_4ecf56e458_c.jpg" width="800" height="534" alt="slideResources"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<!--slide 5-->
				<li>
					<p>To be adequately represented at databases, our feelings also will be transformed into buttons and symbols. The feelings without representation will vanish, others will fit into categories that already exist, like "heart" and "star." Communication will be bright with less ambiguity. Humans communication will improve in efficiency. Because we will talk with machines and through them, everything will have to be structured.</p>
					<a data-flickr-embed="true" data-context="true"  href="https://slides.com/yasodara/deck-1/live#/4" title="slide5"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/4/3928/33827857125_74b70bd55c_c.jpg" width="800" height="525" alt="slide5"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<!--slide 6-->
				<li>
					<p>We still have trillions of opportunities to structure this world. This future is fictional. It does not exist yet.  </p>
						<a data-flickr-embed="true" data-context="true" href="https://slides.com/yasodara/deck-1/live#/5" title="slide6"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/3/2900/32984482654_db60bfec46_c.jpg" width="800" height="550" alt="slide6"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
					<hr class="fancy-line"></hr>
				</li>
<!--slide 7-->
				<li>
					<p>In this fictional world, we know what we are going to say next. We are predictable in almost every situation. And if we leave the curve, it is because we are wrong, mainly, or because we do not fit. The industries will shift the emphasis on improving isolated situations to improving networked situations, considering all the nodes involved in one transaction of datasets.</p>
					<p>This not necessarily a bad scenario. The roads are predictable because of self-driving cars, the time we take showers is also predicted because the water supply is short, the amount of time we spent at cinemas, which theaters we go and which shopping buy, even the amount of time spent in lines is controlled.</p> <p>This story is about a world were poverty, pollution and corruption could be almost erradicated.

				</li>
<!--slide 8-->
				<li>
					<p> Let us say that in this world everything is planned. There is no serendipity. The efforts around improving our lives produced the so-called safety for everyone.
					That is a kind of a world where others than the people themselves eventually control the data. The government just organizes taxes and incomes to distribute it. The world here is completely safe, completely predictable. (Completely insane?)
					</p>
							<a data-flickr-embed="true" data-context="true"  href="https://slides.com/yasodara/deck-1/live#/6" title="slide9"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/3/2909/32984482934_35b92a59f6_c.jpg" width="800" height="518" alt="slide9"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
						<hr class="fancy-line"></hr>
				</li>
<!--slide 9-->
					<li>
						<p>Once that data is integrated with platforms that control everything we do, we traded our sanity for the capacity of knowing what's going to happen. This situation keeps safety first. No wars, no fear in the streets, not too many surprises. </p>

						<p>To represent, Design compresses and simplify complex concepts. Again, this is not necessarily a bad thing. But, there will be a limit so that we remain in control?</p>

						<p>It is a world where we react as we are trained for. (facebook). Maybe we are not going by this way, but anyway I started to look into the motivations on why the web is so centralized and what could balance this scenario.</p>
							<a data-flickr-embed="true" data-context="true"  href="https://slides.com/yasodara/deck-1/live#/9" title="slide12"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/3/2868/33827858365_25eed41b7f_c.jpg" width="800" height="553" alt="slide12"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<!--slide 12-->
					<li>
						<p>One important part of the web, something that makes data interoperable, is metadata. The <a http="https://www.w3.org/RDF">RFD model</a> has a strong influence on metadata on the Web. Conceptually, the RDF data model does not create trees, because it does not have a hierarchy as a concept. It is the same fundamental philosophy than HTTP protocol. The way they can also be used to centralize services intrigued me. </p>
