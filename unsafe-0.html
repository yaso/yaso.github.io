					<h3>Unsafe, but sane</h3>
					<p>This work is an attempt to investigate the structured future that awaits us, and how can humanity use the Internet and not lose the fundamental human rights due to control and surveillance. </p>

					<p>Here lies the presentation made at one of the Fellows Hour, at the Berkman Klein Center - along with my verbal explanation. The links aside contain some sources and references. </p>

					<p>To investigate the problem, I'll make use of Design Fiction. A variation of critical design, but used to deal with stories from cyberspace. Bruce Sterling used this term in 2005 in his book called Shaping things. There is an unmissable article written by him in <a href="http://www.wired.co.uk/article/patently-untrue">the Wired UK</a> about Design Fiction. As I wish to solve a problem that is not real but is a possible future, Design Fiction will help me to tell this story.

					<p>The story that I want to tell presents some troubled unintentional uses of data technologies. As we go digital, we go more structured than ever. In this world, people do everything they can to fit in data models so that they can track everything as a resource and get efficiency. The body is an extension of the digital world and can't function separated from it. </p>
						<a data-flickr-embed="true" data-context="true"  href="https://slides.com/yasodara/deck-1/live#/2" title="slide3"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/3/2925/33442932330_d37835b700_c.jpg" width="800" height="563" alt="slide3"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
					<hr class="fancy-line"></hr>
				</li>
<!--slide 4-->
				<li>
					<p>Our actions are redesigned so they can be translated for machines correctly. As a consequence of the need of controlling everything to obtain efficiency, we let ourselves convert into tables and columns, or other structures that have their roots in mathematical equations.
					So, to tell everyone what we are doing, we trade off complexity for structured exchanges about what we are doing. This register also base our next steps. Everything is a consequence of real parameters founded in science: the amount a person walks, eats, socialize, works, run, commute, watch movies. In a way that we are finally safe from errors.  </p>
						<a data-flickr-embed="true" data-context="true"  href="https://slides.com/yasodara/deck-1/live#/3" title="slide4"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/3/2831/32984482254_0b5bc94969_c.jpg" width="800" height="563" alt="slide4"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
				<hr class="fancy-line"></hr>
				</li>
<!--slide 4-->
				<li>
					<p>In this world, there will be new grids for distribution of everything. New networks for organizing in the best way we can afford - new paths that indicated by the protocols.  </p>
						<a data-flickr-embed="true" data-context="true"  href="https://slides.com/yasodara/deck-1/live#/5" title="slideResources"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/3/2912/33835649685_4ecf56e458_c.jpg" width="800" height="534" alt="slideResources"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<!--slide 5-->
				<li>
					<p>To be adequately represented at databases, our feelings also will be transformed into buttons and symbols. The feelings without representation will vanish, others will fit into categories that already exist, like "heart" and "star." Communication will be bright with less ambiguity. Humans communication will improve in efficiency. Because we will talk with machines and through them, everything will have to be structured.</p>
					<a data-flickr-embed="true" data-context="true"  href="https://slides.com/yasodara/deck-1/live#/4" title="slide5"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/4/3928/33827857125_74b70bd55c_c.jpg" width="800" height="525" alt="slide5"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
					<hr class="fancy-line"></hr>
				</li>
<!--slide 6-->
				<li>
					<p>We still have trillions of opportunities to structure this world. This future is fictional. It does not exist yet.  </p>
						<a data-flickr-embed="true" data-context="true" href="https://slides.com/yasodara/deck-1/live#/5" title="slide6"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/3/2900/32984482654_db60bfec46_c.jpg" width="800" height="550" alt="slide6"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
					<hr class="fancy-line"></hr>
				</li>
<!--slide 7-->
				<li>
					<p>In this fictional world, we know what we are going to say next. We are predictable in almost every situation. And if we leave the curve, it is because we are wrong, mainly, or because we do not fit. The industries will shift the emphasis on improving isolated situations to improving networked situations, considering all the nodes involved in one transaction of datasets.</p>
					<p>This not necessarily a bad scenario. The roads are predictable because of self-driving cars, the time we take showers is also predicted because the water supply is short, the amount of time we spent at cinemas, which theaters we go and which shopping buy, even the amount of time spent in lines is controlled.</p> <p>This story is about a world were poverty, pollution and corruption could be almost erradicated.

						<hr class="fancy-line"></hr>
				</li>
<!--slide 8-->
				<li>
					<p> Let us say that in this world everything is planned. There is no serendipity. The efforts around improving our lives produced the so-called safety for everyone.
					That is a kind of a world where others than the people themselves eventually control the data. The government just organizes taxes and incomes to distribute it. The world here is completely safe, completely predictable. (Completely insane?)
					</p>
							<a data-flickr-embed="true" data-context="true"  href="https://slides.com/yasodara/deck-1/live#/6" title="slide9"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/3/2909/32984482934_35b92a59f6_c.jpg" width="800" height="518" alt="slide9"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
						<hr class="fancy-line"></hr>
				</li>
<!--slide 9-->
					<li>
						<p>Once that data is integrated with platforms that control everything we do, we traded our sanity for the capacity of knowing what's going to happen. This situation keeps safety first. No wars, no fear in the streets, not too many surprises. </p>

						<p>To represent, Design compresses and simplify complex concepts. Again, this is not necessarily a bad thing. But, there will be a limit so that we remain in control?</p>
							<a data-flickr-embed="true" data-context="true"  href="https://slides.com/yasodara/deck-1/live#/8" title="Slide saying that Design simplifies to represent. There is a drawing of Charlie the Unicorn in a distorted way, inviting the reader to go to hell"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/4/3835/32984483394_183effa7ba_c.jpg" width="800" height="566" alt="slide11"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<!--slide 11-->

						<p>It is a world where we react as we are trained for. (facebook). Maybe we are not going by this way, but anyway I started to look into the motivations on why the web is so centralized and what could balance this scenario. One part of the entire platform that called my attention was the connection between the representation made so the user can have access and the data model that stores it digitally. made</p>
							<a data-flickr-embed="true" data-context="true"  href="https://slides.com/yasodara/deck-1/live#/9" title="In the slide I explain that the world is going to be controlled but safe."><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/3/2868/33827858365_25eed41b7f_c.jpg" width="800" height="553" alt="slide12"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
						<hr class="fancy-line"></hr>
					</li>
<!--slide 12-->
					<li>
						<p>One important part of the web, something that makes data interoperable, is metadata. The <a http="https://www.w3.org/RDF">RFD model</a> has a strong influence on metadata on the Web. Conceptually, the RDF data model does not create trees, because it does not have a hierarchy as a concept. It is the same fundamental philosophy than HTTP protocol. The way they can also be used to centralize services intrigued me. </p>
							<a data-flickr-embed="true" data-context="true"  href="https://slides.com/yasodara/deck-1/live#/10" title="RDF"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/3/2895/33698581201_a2a2b8412b_c.jpg" width="800" height="547" alt="Figure showing RDF relationships representation"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<!--slide 13-->

						<p>So, I stepped in the work of <a href="https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Alexander">Cristopher Alexander</a>. He inspired several movements of programming languages creation, especially for object orientated languages. He influenced even in agile methodologies and patterns for the design of programming languages itself. But his main work is about urban design. In his research evolved into several branches of design, embracing sustainable design and design for communities. His work with patterns aimed to create a visual ontology to transform architecture into something that more people could apply.</p>
							<a data-flickr-embed="true" data-context="true"  href="https://slides.com/yasodara/deck-1/live#/11"  title="Cristopher Alexander"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/4/3894/33827858565_03ee8cd389_c.jpg" width="800" height="519" alt="Slide that presents some qualities of the work of cristopher Alexander and how incredible he is"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
						<hr class="fancy-line"></hr>
					</li>
<!--slide 14-->
					<li>
						<p>The way he described cities, and the calculus of mathematical origins to oppression and the free flow of information in the urban environment, considering them as interfaces to the movement of information, called my attention. I assume that the representations on the Web, and the regulations to what we are bowed, are easier to redesign than cities. Because of that, the idea that the digital environment is a overlay of urban spaces comes in hand to find specific strategies to liberate humans from total control, even that we go digital, completely networked. </p>

						<hr class="fancy-line"></hr>
					</li>
<!--slide 15-->
				<li>
					<p>Interaction design is full of patterns. HTML5 interfaces are full of patterns that transform into interfaces that are too, patterns. Consider them as bricks of the Urban Digital environment. Tracing similarities between patterns can help us understand how to deal with the elements present in the digital urban spaces. </p>

					<p>This figure shows an example of the use patterns, as Nicolas Negroponte used that to map different types of interaction of humans with materials around cities. </p>

						<hr class="fancy-line"></hr>
					</li>
<!--slide 17-->
						<li>
							<p>Here, another example of work with patterns.  Pattern exploration can help us to give responses using design to trigger certain processes and behaviors.</p>
									<a data-flickr-embed="true" data-context="true"  href="https://slides.com/yasodara/deck-1/live#/15" title="patterns to susteinable design"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/3/2854/33683171212_7329b912b2_c.jpg" width="800" height="552" alt="Patterns to create behavior"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
								<hr class="fancy-line"></hr>
						</li>
<!--slide 17-->
  					<li>
							<p>Cristopher Alexander cataloged more than 200 patterns from cities. Some of them fit into Internet spaces. Also, it shows that information can interact within the context of the interdependence of platforms and apps. Digital topography must considerate platform as <i>urbe</i>.</p>
									<a data-flickr-embed="true" data-context="true"  href="https://slides.com/yasodara/deck-1/live#/16" title="Design of a pattern"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/3/2832/33683171312_5ed5fd82f3_c.jpg" width="800" height="555" alt="Design of a pattern"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
								<hr class="fancy-line"></hr>
						</li>
<!--slide 17-->
						<li>
							<p>So, the cycle of information that permeates the applications in which humans circulate with their digital fragments shows us that there is an overlap of small "cities." These towns are the applications. Sometimes, some applications share more users, like Facebook, Instagram, and Whatsapp. Given that they have more control over the information that flows, they can retain digital citizen in their limits.  But, besides the overlap of apps as towns, the presence of different dimensions of information connecting users shows that an active subculture can take users from one application to another. Like Twitter and Facebook, for example.  The flow of information in these subcultures liberates people from the walled digital <i>cities</i>. </p>

							<p>One f the patterns most easily comparable with digital urbe is the n.75: the family house. In this pattern, we observe the levels of privacy and the mapping of functions of each small environment. The private realms and the communal living are directly similar to private groups in apps versus public groups, or pages dedicated to conversation between many participants, open to occasional visitors. </p>

<!--slide 19-->

								<p>The echo chambers may have design problems. Maybe conversations should be designed in order to guarantee values that are not embedded into the design of walls, or twitter feeds, for example. </p>
